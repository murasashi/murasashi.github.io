# Optimization Lecture 01


## Structure

1. Constraints: $f_{i}(\cdot)$
2. Penalties: $\theta_{i}(\cdot)$
3. Optimality


## Point 01: Constraints

1. Inequality Constraints
2. Equality Constraints
3. Abstract Constraints


## Point 02: Penalties

- Barrier Function
- Linear Penalties
- Quadratic Penalties


## Point 03: Optimality 

Elements on the objective function $f(\cdot)$ includes

1. Well-definedness
	- effective domain 
	- properness 
2. Minimum 
	- global
	- local 
3. Regularization 
	- Neighborhoods to implement penalties.
	- Indicators to implement constraints.
