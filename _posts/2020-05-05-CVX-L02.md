## Point 01: Projection to nonempty closed convex [set --> cone].

We first recall the __projection to nonempty closed convex set $C$__

> Theorem 3.1.1.  Given a nonempty closed convex set $C\subset  \mathbb{R}^{d}$.  Define the projection $P_{C}(x)$ of a point $x$ to nonempty closed convex set $C$ as 
> 
> $$ P_{C}(x) = \inf_{y \in C}2^{-1}\|y-x\|^2.$$
> 
> Then, a point $y_{x}\in C$ is the projection $P_{C}(x)$ iff
>  
>  $$\langle x-y_{x}, y-y_{x} \rangle \le 0\text{ for all } y\in C.$$

The goal of this post is to understand __projection to nonempty closed convex set $K$__

> Proposition 3.2.3 Let $K$ be a closed convex cone. Then $y_{x}=P_{K}(x)$ iff
>  
>  $$y_{x}\in K, x-y_{x}\in K^{\circ}, \langle x-y_{x}, y_{x} \rangle = 0,$$
>  where $K$ is a convex cone and $K^{\circ}$ is the polar cone of $K$.

Q. Where is the convex cone in LASSO constrain as model structure?

## Point 02: What is convex cone?

###  Cone
A __cone__ is a set such that
> the __open__ half-line $\{\alpha x: \alpha >0\}$ is strictly contained in $K$ when $x\in K$.

- A cone is __not__ supposed to contain $0$.

### Convex Cone

- Example 1: Set of __equality and inequality constraints__ forms a convex cone
	- $$K=\{x|\langle s_1, x\rangle = 0, \cdots, \langle s_m, x\rangle = 0, \langle s_{m+1}, x\rangle \le 0, \cdots, \langle s_{p}, x\rangle \le 0\}$$

- A cone $K$ is convex iff it is __algebratically closed under sum__, i.e. $K+K \subset K$.
- __Convexity__ means the set should contains __all midpoints__ between any two members. 

### Polar Cone

Let $K$ be a convex cone. The __polar__ cone of $K$ is the collection of __the point that on the other side__ of _all_ members of $K$; formally, 
$$K^{\circ} \equiv\{s \in \mathbb{R}^{d}| \langle s, x \rangle \le 0\text{  for all  } x \in K\}.$$

## Point 03: Main Argument

- Let $K$ be a closed convex cone. Recall the definition of projection $P_{K}(x)$ of $x$ onto $K$

$$ P_{K}(x) = \inf_{y \in K}2^{-1}\|y-x\|^2.$$

### Step 1: Description of Projection on closed _convex set_

Since $K$ is also a closed convex set, the projection $P_{K}(x)$ satisfies

$$\langle x-P_{K}(x), y-P_{K}(x) \rangle \le 0\text{ for all } y\in K. \hspace{20pt}(\clubsuit)$$

### Step 2: Use _a_ member description of the _cone_

Since by definition of projection $P_{K}(x)\in K$, then any member $y$ in $K$ has a form $y = \alpha P_{K}(x)$ for some $\alpha \ge 0$. __Fix__ a point $y\in K$, substitute the  member form into $(\clubsuit)$ gives 

$$\langle x-P_{K}(x), (\alpha-1)P_{K}(x) \rangle \le 0\text{ for some } \alpha\ge 0. \hspace{20pt}(\diamondsuit)$$

### Step 3: Extend the argument to _all_ members in the cone

Now, for __all__ member $y$ in the cone $K$, the equation $(\diamondsuit)$ should always holds, which gives the equation 


$$(\alpha-1) \langle x-P_{K}(x), P_{K}(x) \rangle \le 0\text{ for all } \alpha\ge 0. \hspace{20pt}(\heartsuit)$$

### Step 4: Cone contains both _shorter_ and _longer_

Since $\alpha \ge 0$, the term $(\alpha-1)$ can be both positive and negative. Since in both case the equation $(\heartsuit)$ should hold, we infer that 

$$ \langle x-P_{K}(x), P_{K}(x) \rangle = 0. \hspace{20pt}(\spadesuit)$$


### Step 5: Echo the cone result with projection to convex set

The cone result $(\spadesuit)$ has a consequence on $(\clubsuit)$ as

$$\langle x-P_{K}(x), y\rangle \le 0\text{ for all } y\in K. \hspace{20pt}(\mho)$$
By definition of polar cone, the $(\mho)$ means
$$x-P_{K}(x) \in K^{\circ}.$$

### Step Conclusion: Polar decomposition

We now are ready to appreciate the result 

> Proposition 3.2.3 Let $K$ be a closed convex cone. Then $y_{x}=P_{K}(x)$ iff
>  
>  $$y_{x}\in K, x-y_{x}\in K^{\circ}(\mho), \langle x-y_{x}, y_{x} \rangle = 0 (\spadesuit),$$
>  where $K$ is a convex cone and $K^{\circ}$ is the polar cone of $K$.

## Point 04: Why polar decomposition solves the projection

- Recall that the objective function in projection is $f_{x}(y)\equiv 2^{-1}\|y-x\|^2$, we have 
  - $$f_{x}(y)=2^{-1}\|[y-P_{K}(x)]+[P_{K}(x)-x]\|^2 \ge f_{x}(P_{K}(x))+\langle y-P_{K}(x), P_{K}(x)-x \rangle.$$

- From the polar decomposition, we have
	- $$\langle y-P_{K}(x), P_{K}(x)-x \rangle= \langle y, P_{K}(x)-x \rangle = -\langle y, x- P_{K}(x)\rangle \ge 0,$$
where the first equality by $(\spadesuit)$ and the last inequality by $(\mho)$.

## Extension

- Moreau's polar decomposition theorem of the Euclidean space.
