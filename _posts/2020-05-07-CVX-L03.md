### Recall: Definition of Polar Cone

First, we recall the definition of a polar cone.

Let $K$ be a convex cone. The __polar__ cone of $K$ is the collection of __the point that on the other side__ of _all_ members of $K$; formally, 
$$K^{\circ} \equiv\{s \in \mathbb{R}^{d}| \langle s, x \rangle \le 0\text{  for all  } x \in K\}.$$

## Structure

1. The definition of normal cone and tangent cone
2. Appreciate Prop 5.2.4.
3. Implications 

## Point 01: Define $T_{C}(x)$ and $N_{C}(x)$

Given a __closed convex__ set $C \subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$. We focus on feeling the __interaction(?)__ between the inner product of tangent cone and normal cone; that is,

$$\langle d, s \rangle$$
where $d \in T_{C}(x)$ and $s \in N_{C}(x)$. This image breaks down the __first order approximation__ term to explain the minimization scheme.

### Tangent Cone $T_{C}(x)$

The __tangent cone__ $T_{C}(x)$ of the closed convex set $C$ at a position $x$ is the __closure of the cone generated by $C-\{x\}$__; formally, 

$$T_{C}(x)=\text{cl}\{d\in\mathbb{R}^{d}: d = \alpha (y-x), y\in C, \alpha \ge 0\}.$$

That is, connect any member $y$ of the closed convex set $C$ to the position $x$, multiply the connected segment with non-negative real number to __generate a ray through the segment__. In image, it's like we stand at position $x$ and spotlight the closed convex set $C$, then the __shadow__ is the tangent cone $T_{C}(x)$.


### Normal Cone $N_{C}(x)$

The __normal cone__ $N_{C}(x)$ of the closed convex set $C$ at a position $x$ is the __collection of all normal direction (the opposite directions) w.r.t. all segment from members of $C$ to position $x$__; formally, 

$$N_{C}(x) = \{s \in \mathbb{R}^{d}: \langle s, y-x\rangle\le 0 \text{  for all  }y\in C\}.$$

That is, first write out all connected segment from the position $x$ to any member $y$ of the closed convex set $C$. Find the __opposite directions__ of all these segments

## Point 02: Play the definition of polar cone

### The polar cone of a tangent cone

>  $$(T_{C}(x))^{\circ} \subset N_{C}(x)$$


Pick a member $d$ from a tangent cone $T_{C}(x)$, it has a form $d =\alpha (y-x)$ for some $y\in C$. A candidate vector $s$ to belong to the polar cone $(T_{C}(x))^{\circ}$ needs to satisfy $0 \ge \langle s, d \rangle =\alpha \langle s, y-x \rangle$ for some $\alpha \ge 0$, leads to a fact that, for any $s \in (T_{C}(x))^{\circ}$, it holds that $\langle s, y-x \rangle\le 0$ for all $y\in C$. It fits the definition of normal cone, so $s \in N_{C}(x)$. 

### The polar cone of a normal cone

>  $$N_{C}(x) \subset (T_{C}(x))^{\circ}$$

Play with the definition reversely, we have the statement. 


In conclusion, both cones concern the __connected segments__ from the __position $x$__ to __any member $y$ of the closed convex cone $C$.



## Point 03: Implications


### Example 1: m linear constraints

- The __m linear constraints__ forms a closed convex polyhedron 

$$C = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}: \langle s_{j}, x \rangle \le r_{j} \text{  for  } j = 1,\cdots, m\}$$

- At a position $x \in C$, the set of __active constraints__is

$$J(x) = \{j = 1,\cdots, m; \langle s_{j}, x \rangle = r_{j}\}.$$

- The tangent cone $T_{C}(x)$ in this case

$$T_{C}(x) = \{d \in \mathbb{R}^{d}: \langle s_{j}, d \rangle \le 0\text{  for  } j \in J(x)\}$$

- The normal cone $N_{C}(x)$ in this case

$$N_{C}(x)=\text{cone}\{s_j: j \in J(x)\} = \{\sum_{j \in J(x)}\alpha_j s_j: \alpha_j \ge 0\}.$$

In words, at a __feasible position__ $x\in C$ _at boundary case_ has  actives a subset of constraints. The index of active constraints at feasible position $x$ is collected in $J(x)$. To find a __direction $d$__ for feasible position $x$ to move, we look into the __tangent cone $T_{C}(x)$__ since its member gives objective decrease (in first order approximation sense). Therefore, there are $|J(x)|$ directions to give objective decrease; and the __linear combination__ of these $|J(x)|$ directions forms a direction that the next step direction should be _normal_ with.


## Next Step

- How to present __finding derivative__ as a sequence of __cones inclusion process__?
