## Learning Objective

2. [Lemma 8] The main entropy inequality

- A functional Hoeffding-type deviation inequality.

## Point 01: View Suprema of Empirical Process from monotone convergence theorem

Consider a _countable_ class of functions $\mathcal{F} = \{t, t \in \mathbb{N}\}$ __with finite sup norm__ $\|f\|_{\infty}\le b < \infty$. Consider $n$ _independent_ random variables $\xi_1,\cdots, \xi_n$ and set $X_{i,t} = f_{t}(\xi_i)$ as the function value of $\xi_{i}$ under $f_{t}$.  The argument based on __monotone convergence theorem__ suggests we approach the suprema of empirical process from __N candidate  function's empirical process__ then let $N$ go to infinity; namely,

$$\sup_{f\in\mathcal{F}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(\xi_i)=\lim_{N\to \infty}\sup_{t\in[N]}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i,t}.$$

Hence, the concentration problem can be treated in the setting on $n$ independent __N-dimensional random vector__ $X_1, \cdots, X_{n}$ (each entry of $X_i$ denotes the function value of $\xi_i$ under candidate function $\{f_1,\cdots, f_{N}\}$.

## Point 02: Entropy of a non-negative measurable function.

Consider the function $\Phi(\cdot)$ defined on $\mathbb{R}_{+}$ by 

$$\Phi(u) = u\log u,$$

a non-negative measurable function $g$ and a probability measure $P$ such that $g$ is $P-$measurable. The __entropy__ of $g$ with respect to $P$ is the __Jensen gap__ of the __expectional operator__ $E_{P}[\cdot]$ with function $\Phi(\cdot)$; namely,

$$H_{\mathbb{P}}(f)\equiv \mathbb{E}_{P}[\Phi(g)]-\Phi[\mathbb{E}_{P}[g]].$$
