## Points 01: Binary Search Problem with Pricing Loss

The __binary search problem__ is to guess an unknown real number $\theta^{*} \in [0,1]$. At time t, we guess $\hat{y}_t$, and then the oracle replies if $\hat{y}_t \le \theta^{*}$ or $\hat{y}_t > \theta^{*}$.

The __multidimensional binary search problem__ is to guess an unknown real number $\langle \theta^{*} , x \rangle$ for the context $x \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$ (e.g. _product feature_). At time $t$, we guess $\hat{y}_{t}$, and the oracle replies if $\hat{y}_t\le \langle \theta^{*} , x \rangle$ or $\hat{y}_t>\langle \theta^{*} , x \rangle$. 

### 1. Deterministic Oracle (Machine Learning Style)
A __mistake (regret)__ $r$ in a multidimensional binary search problem is defined __a guess with an error larger than__ $\epsilon$. That is, at time $t$, the mistake $r_{t}$ of our guess $\hat{y}_t$ is formulated as 

$$r_{t}=\begin{cases}0&\text{ if  }|\hat{y}_t-\langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle | \le \epsilon \\ 1&\text{ if  }|\hat{y}_t-\langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle | > \epsilon\end{cases}.$$

A __symmetric loss__ is defined by

$$l(\langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle, \hat{y}_t) = |\hat{y}_t-\langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle| $$

A __pricing loss__ for guessing product value $\hat{y}_{t}$ is defined as the difference between __true product value__ and __expected revenue of guessed product value__ 

$$l(\langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle, \hat{y}_t) = \langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle - \hat{y}_tI(\hat{y}_t\le \langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle)$$

### 2. Stochastic Oracle (Statistical Machine Learning Style)

#### (i). symmetric loss
In __symmetric loss__ case, if we believe there are errors $\epsilon$ on the oracle's answer in the sense

$$l(\langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle+\epsilon_{t}, \hat{y}_t) = |\hat{y}_t-\langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle-\epsilon_{t}|,$$

then it makes sense to do the problem under __structural model__

$$y_{t} = \langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle+\epsilon_{t}.$$

Under the model, we come up with a estimator $\hat{\theta}_{t}$ and make our guess $\hat{y}_{t} = \langle x_{t},\hat{\theta}_{t}\rangle$, which suffers loss 

$$l(\langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle+\epsilon_{t}, \langle x_{t},\hat{\theta}_{t}\rangle) = |\langle x_{t}, \hat{\theta}_{t}- \theta^{*}\rangle-\epsilon_{t}|.$$

Then people turn it into square loss, make __assumptions__ on the error $\epsilon_{t}$ and then draw several conclusions.

#### (ii) pricing loss
In __pricing loss__ case, if we believe there are errors $\epsilon$ on the oracle's answer on __product value__ in the sense

$$l(\langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle+\epsilon_{t}, \hat{y}_t) =\langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle+\epsilon_{t} - \hat{y}_tI(\hat{y}_t\le \langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle+\epsilon_{t})$$

Further assume the error $\epsilon_{t}$ has distribution $F_{t}(\cdot)$, then the pricing loss has the form 

$$
l(\langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle+\epsilon_{t}, \hat{y}_t)=\begin{cases}\langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle+\epsilon_{t}&\text{ with probability } 1-F_{t}(\hat{y}_t- \langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle)\\ [\langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle-\hat{y}_{t}]+\epsilon_{t}&\text{ with probability } F_{t}(\hat{y}_t- \langle x_{t},\theta^{*}\rangle)\end{cases},
$$
which is a __asymmetric loss__ (similar asymmetric loss appears in MAB model, main research point in bandit literature). In the first case, we fail to sell the produce and loss the _true product value_; in the second case, we make a deal and loss the _difference between true product value and guessed product value_. This makes perfect sense!


## Points 02: Personalized Revenue Maximization Pricing Policy

### Initialization 

- Data Streams: $D_{[t]}=\{(x_s, p_{s}, y_{s})\}_{s=1}^{t}$ for $x_{s}$: product context, $p_{s}$: pricing (guested product value) and $y_{s}$: sale status (sold or not sold)
- Regularization Scheme: $\lambda_{t}$

### Algorithm

1. Fit the regularized MLE $\{\hat{\theta}_{t}\}$ stream on the observed data stream $\{D_{[t]}\}$  

$$\hat{\theta}_{t} = \arg\min_{\theta\in \mathbb{R}^{p}} l(D_{[t]}; \theta)+\lambda_{t}\|\theta\|_1\text{  where  }l(D_{[t]}; \theta) = -t^{-1}\sum_{s=1}^{t}\log\mathbb{P}(y_{s}; p_{s}, x_{s}, \theta).$$

2. For the incoming new context _$x_{t+1}$_, estimate the demand probability distribution 

$$\mathbb{P}(y; p, x_{t+1}, \hat{\theta}_{t})$$

(This is the estimated probability under estimator $\hat{\theta}_{t}$ of successfully selling the product $x_{t+1}$ at price $p$.)

3. Give pricing for the context $x_{t+1}$ that maximized the expected revenue

$$\hat{p}_{t+1}\equiv\arg\max_{p \in [p_{\min}, p_{\max}]} p \cdot\mathbb{P}(y; p, x_{t+1}, \hat{\theta}_{t}).$$
